---LIST----

#Wirte a program to print True if the first element or last element is divisible by 4 in the given list

#Write a program to print True if the first and last elements are equal and odd numbers in the given list

#Write a program to print True if the sum of the first and last element are equal from the given two lists

#Write a program to print the sum of all the element in the given list.

#Write a program to sort a list of integer element

#Write a program to print a new list by doing a left rotate on the given list.
# Ex input: [4,5,6,7]  output: [5,6,7,4]

Write a program to find the maximum number from the given list of numbers and replace all the numbers from the list with maximum 
number

Given two list x and y, print new list as output which includes all the elements of x and y except 
for the first and last elements

Write a program to print True if the given list contains multiple of 4 or 8

--SHALLOW COPYING--------

Given a list 
colours1 = ['red','green'] with the help of a new list, modify the list colors1, such that
colours1 = ["red","blue"]


Given a list
list1 = ['a','b','c','d'] with the help of 'slice' construct and a new list, make changes in list1, such that 
list1=['a','x','c','d']. Verify if the original list is modified.


Given a list, lst1 = ['a','b',['ab','ba']] with the help of 'slice' construct and a new list, modifylst1 such that
lst1 = ['a','b',['ab','d']]

---DEEP COPYING------------------------

GIven a list
lst1 = ['a','b',['ab','ba']]
Use the function deepcopy and a new list to make changes in the lst2. Verify if the list is modified


Given a listlst1 = ['a','b',['ab','ba']]
Use the function 'copy' and a new list to make changes in the lst2. Verify if the list is modified


--STRING--

1) Write a program to reverse a string

2) Write a program to print a new string which contains 4 copies of the last three characters from the given string.

3) Write a program to print the output string which contains last half + first half of the given string. The given string is of even length.

4) Given a string, print the output string by removing the first and last character of the string.

5) Given two strings of different length and print output string as shortest string + largest string + shortest string

6) Given a string, write a program which rotates left 2 and prints the output below.
Ex input : Hello
output : lloHe

7) Concatente two given strings by omitting the first character

8) Write a program to count the number of occurrences of each character in a given string

9) Write a program to convert all the vowels to uppercase for the given input string.

10) Write a program to reverse the given input list

11) Write a program to count number of occurrences of vowels in a given string

12) Write a program to convert lower case to upper case letter?

13) Write a program to print the longest length string from given input list of strings.
